#  The setup options varied slightly between GCP and Azure making 100% direct comparisons difficult, Azure seemed to be the more expensive of the 2
# coming in at 0.096/hr vs GCPs 0.03/hr.  With more familiarization of available options it may be possible to close the price gap.
# Starting and stoppping each VM was similarly easy, but initial setup was easier on Azure.  I also find azure a little easier to navigate, 
# when looking for a previous created VM to connect to, but that may be due to me being unfamiliar with the program
